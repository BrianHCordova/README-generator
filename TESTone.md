## Installation
The user must have node.js installed for their OS. The user must then open their integrated terminal in the index.js file. Once open, the user will type:  npm i inquirer@8.2.4 and hit enter. This will install the inquirer package from npm, specifically version 8.2.4. 

## Usage
To use the application, open the integrated terminal in the index.js file. Then, enter: node index.js in the terminal to initialize prompts. You'll be prompted to answer questions such as providing a title and description for your README.md file, explaining how to use the application, selecting a license from a list of options, specifying how others can contribute to the project, entering test instructions, providing your GitHub username (which will be linked to the page), and supplying your email (which will create a clickable link for email correspondence). Once you've answered all questions, a TESTone.md (or README.md) file will be generated containing your responses.
